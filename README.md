# Terlan AI - YOLO App

This is a **prototype web application** built with **Flask**, created as my **first Flask project** during a **hackathon**.  
The main goal was to experiment with **AI-powered video analysis** and web development in a short timeframe.

## Features

- **Video Uploads:** Supports common formats (MP4, AVI, WebM, OGG). AVI files are automatically converted to MP4.  
- **AI Video Analysis:** Uses a YOLO object detection model with **real-time progress tracking**.  
- **Results & Reports:** View analysis results in a dedicated folder and export reports in CSV, XLSX, or PDF.  
- **Dashboard:** Track statistics, recent activity, and a simple map snapshot.  
- **User Settings:** Basic management and reporting features.

## Purpose

This project is a **hackathon prototype**, meant as a **learning experience**, demonstrating:  

- Integration of AI models with a web interface  
- File uploads and background processing  
- Real-time tracking for long-running tasks  
- Reporting and basic user management  

Even though it’s a prototype, it shows the potential of combining **computer vision** and **web applications** and serves as a foundation for future improvements.
